In the sequential system the timing signal which disables the roll engines during service module separation was changed from a 5.5- to a 2-second interval, and a cutoff time of 25 seconds was incorporated for the translation engines instead of allowing them to fire until the propellant was depleted. These timing changes were instituted to minimize the effects of fuel slosh and to improve service-module separation characteristics. The stripline units in the high-gain antenna were changed to an improved design. A detachable filter was provided for installing over the cabin heat exchanger exhaust to assist in collection of free lumar dust after crew transfer from the lunar module.

The only difficulty in coordinating the training activities was the scheduling of the lunar landing training vehicle for the Commander. The late availability of this vehicle, the large amount of time required for this type of training, and the need to travel between Houston and Cape Kennedy complicated the training Schedule significantly. Because a primary objective was a field geology experiment as part of the second extravehicular excursion, considerable emphasis was placed on geology training.

The Command Module Pilot had manually adjusted the antenna settings to plus 23 degrees in pitch and 267 degrees in yaw, as requested by the ground 7 hours earlier.

With the high-gain antenna in the wide beam mode and nearly boresighted, the uplink and downlink signal strengths should have been at least equal to the signal strength obtained with an omnidirectional antenna.
